    <h2> ABOUT CIT</h2>
    <p>The College of Industrial Technology (CIT) is located in Laoag City, with an external campus in Paoay, Ilocos Norte.It was chosen in 1983 as one of the 21 public 
    <br>technological institutes in the Technical Vocational Education Project (TVEP) of the then Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) mandated 
    <br>to produce the needed manpower for industrial growth and development in the country.

    <p>The college was an accredited regional trade skills training and testing center in Region 1 by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) 
    <br>and a regional training center in ceramic by the Product Design and Development Center of the Philippines.

    <P>It also hosts a Toyota Technology Center (TTC), one among 18 established in nominated partner schools in the country under the Toyota Automotive Education Program 
    <br>(TAEP) of the Toyota Motor Philippines Foundation (TMPF) Inc., which is envisioned to become the regional skills development center in automotive servicing.
    
    <P>The University is Deputized by CHED to implement the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) with the BS INDUSTRIAL 
    <br>TECHNOLOGY as one of the ETEEAP Degree Programs offered by the College. The ETEEAP is a comprehensive educational assessment program at the tertiary level that  
    <br>recognizes, accredits, and gives equivalencies to knowledge, skills, attitudes, and values gained by individuals from relevant work. This program recognizes 
    <br>hat education and the acquisition of higher expertise also take place beyond the confines of the classroom. The BSIT degreemay be granted to individuals

    <br>through equivalency and assessment by assessors of the College.
